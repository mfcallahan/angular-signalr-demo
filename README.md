# angular-signalr-demo

This branch, dotnet5-angular12, contains the second iteration of the SignalR + Angular app demonstrated in my [blog post](https://mfcallahan.blog/2020/11/05/how-to-implement-signalr-in-a-net-core-angular-web-application/).  It was built with .NET 5 and Angular 12.  See the [master branch](https://github.com/mfcallahan/angular-signalr-demo/tree/master) of this repo for the most recent version of the app, built with .NET 6 and Angular 14.
